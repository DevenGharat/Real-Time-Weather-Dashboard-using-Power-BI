üå¶Ô∏è Real-Time Weather Dashboard using Power BI

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time, dynamic weather dashboard in Power BI by integrating live data from a Weather API. The dashboard showcases current weather conditions, air quality, and forecasts with automatic updates and visually rich KPIs.

üöÄ Project Highlights

API Integration: Consumes real-time weather data (temperature, forecasts, air quality, etc.) from a public Weather API using JSON.
Data Transformation: Structured and cleaned API data into multiple tables (Current, Daily, Hourly Forecasts, and Air Quality) using Power Query.
Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables and added dynamic slicers to filter by city.
Interactive Visuals: Designed KPIs, trend charts, and air quality indicators with conditional formatting and color-coded alerts.
Custom Design: Applied a professional dark theme, weather icons, and DAX-based time formatting for sunrise/sunset visuals.
Automation: Published the dashboard to Power BI Service with scheduled data refresh, ensuring always up-to-date weather insights.

üß† Key Learnings
Understanding and using APIs effectively in Power BI.
Applying best practices in data modeling and transformation.
Creating professional dashboards with themes, icons, and dynamic visuals.
Managing API limits and authentication smartly using temporary API keys.

üìà Outcome
A visually appealing and fully functional real-time weather dashboard, ideal for portfolio display or practical use. This project strengthens skills in API integration, Power Query, DAX, and Power BI visualization design.
